A silly website I made to taunt my good friend Greg about his red/green colorblindness.

The website can be accessed at www.IsGregColorblind.com.

Although it is a bit overkill, I use Google App Engine with a simple python backend to spit out the html/css/javascript.  So basically this serves as my form of free hosting :)
